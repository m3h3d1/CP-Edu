The Art of Debugging
*Run with n=1.
*Check overflow(long long vs int).
*Check all array bounds.
*Check if m, n aren’t misused.
*Printed enough new lines or extra new lines?
*Make sure output format is right(including YES/NO vs Yes/No or newline vs spaces).
*Have you cleared the vectors ?
*Make sure two ints aren’t multiplied to get a long long.
*Output enough digits after decimal point.
*Check the constraints again.
*When using multiple dfs recursions check if inside one dfs another dfs is called or not.
*Shouldn't you print the case number?
*Are you using the correct mod value?
*"I spent a lot of my time debugging my solution without any success, after the contest I discovered that the obstacles in the input is 'x' (small one) while I was thinking it was 'X' (capital), I lost a bronze medal because of it :(" - kingofnumbers
*Set or multiset?
*Different Variables with the same name?
*Inside 2d loop are you using i++ instead of j++?
*Are you using ceil function? Then remove it!
*Is inf large enough?
*For multiple queries are you returning 0 inside the queries?
*For max and min have you initialized the values by a good enough value?
*Are you using the local variable of the same name when global variable was required to be used?
*"Declared a counter of type char instead of int , resulted in passing of pretests and failing of system test. :)" - A random CF user
*"I subtracted 1 in a for loop from v.size(). Guess what happened when the input vector is empty?" - A random CF user
*"for (int i = n - 1; i--; i >= 0) instead of: for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) It passed pretests and failed systests" - A random CF user
*Are you using memset correctly?
*Use bool operators using brackets. Beware!!! E.g. ans = ans + k == 0 vs ans = ans + (k == 0).
*Have you deleted debug(x) lines? It might get you TLE!
*It may be scanf("%d" , x). where &x is missing.
*Instead of printing NO printed N0. (with a zero).
*Are you erasing values from a set or an stl while parallelly traversing the elements of the stl? Please don’t. This is not nice!
*Don't use scanf or printf while using ios_base.
*Still have no idea? Try to recode from scratch or see others solutions.
