Task: given two numbers n and r, count the number of integers in the interval [1;r] that are relatively prime to n (their greatest common divisor is 1).

Let's solve the inverse problem - compute the number of not mutually primes with n.

We will denote the prime factors of n as pi(i=1â‹¯k).

How many numbers in the interval [1;r] are divisible by pi? The answer to this question is: floor(r/Pi)

However, if we simply sum these numbers, some numbers will be summarized several times (those that share multiple pi as their factors). Therefore, it is necessary to use the inclusion-exclusion principle.

We will iterate over all 2^k subsets of Pis, calculate their product and add or subtract the number of multiples of their product.
